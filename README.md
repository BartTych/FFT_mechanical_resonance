what i did here is a simple simulation of transient respons of a mechanical system to excitation at one given frequency.
in case of Jeffcott rotor i look at the system respons in a csys rotating at rotational speed of the shaft so the excitation in form of eccentricity
is at the same point of the plane. response moves to point of steady state operation (phase and amplitude) in a pattern suprisingly similar to one in videos about FFT and Laplace transform. 
in case of simple harmonic oscylator it is quite suprising that after ploting system response in phase space and rotating it, result is the same.
